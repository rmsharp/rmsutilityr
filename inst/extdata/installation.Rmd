## Installation

<!-- ### Installation from Source -->
<!-- A very manual approach is to use the following code, which -->
<!-- assumes you have all of the dependencies already installed: -->

<!-- ```{r install-rmsutilityr, include = TRUE, eval = FALSE} -->
<!-- install_path <- "c:/R Library" -->
<!-- source_path <- "d:Labkey data" -->
<!-- source <- "rmsutilityr.1.0.76.tar.gz" -->
<!-- install.packages(paste0(source_path, "/", source), type = "source", repos = NULL, -->
<!--                      lib = install_path) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- This will fail if you do not have the dependencies already  -->
<!-- installed, but the error message will provide the name(s) of the packages  -->
<!-- needed. -->
<!-- However, as soon as the source packages is updated that code no longer  -->
<!-- work because the filename is wrong. -->


### github.com Installation

In addition to installing from CRAN the current development version can be 
intalled from GitHub.
[github.com/rmsharp/rmsutilityr](https://github.com/rmsharp/rmsutilityr) 
as all of the dependencies are automatically installed.

You can install **rmsutilityr** from github with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rmsharp/rmsutilityr")
```

All missing dependencies should be automatically installed.
